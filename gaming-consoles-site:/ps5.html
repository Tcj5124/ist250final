            <h2>PlayStation 5 (PS5)</h2>

            <p>
                The PlayStation 5 is known and beyond popular for its swift load times, smooth performance,
                and a strong lineup of exclusive/premium games.
                When it comes to PlayStation, the graphics are immaculate.
                I would say, if you care most about single-player story games,
                immersive graphics that are spot on, and the PlayStation ecosystem, the PS5
                is usually the first console most heavy gamers consider purchasing.
            </p>

            <p>
                On this page, I'll break down in small pieces what the PS5 does well, who it's really best for,
                and what you should know before you think about purchasing.

                <h3>Exclusive Games</h3>
                <p>
                    PlayStation is known for exclusive and story-driven games that really feel like it's "premium,"
                    in a sense, especiallyif you like cinematic, single-player experiences.

                <h3>DualSense Controller</h3>
                <p>
                    This controller, specifically, has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which can make driving,
                    shooting, and movement feel more realistic than what it actually is, in my opinion, in supported video ganes.

                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    The developers of PS5 really built the gaming console for users to experience fast loading and smooth gameplay. 
                    Now, many games support 4K visuals and higher frame rates depending on the game itself and your TV.

                <img src="images/disc-vs-digital.jpg" alt="PlayStation 5 Disc Edition compared to PlayStation5 Digital Edition">

                <h3>Disc vs. Digital</h3>
                <p>
                    Regarding the Disc Edition, it plays physical games and movies. The Digital Edition skips the disc drive
                    (and most times, it's usually cheaper for folds), but you'll buy everything online, which may or may not be the best option.

            <h2>PS5 Buying Advice</h2>
            <p>
                In my personal opinion, if you already have friends that game on PlayStation, 
                the alone can be a big reason to transition into owning a PS5, especially if
                you play online. Also, if oyu like owning physical games or buying used games
                at like GameStop or GameFly, the Disc Edition is more than worth it.
